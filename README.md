# chip8

My take on a CHIP-8 emulator, referencing http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#2.2 as a guide.

### Project Goals

- I've been wanting to write an emulator, so I picked the simplest one I could find for my first one
- Leverage modern C++ language features where applicable as a learning experience
